# v1ta: The Decentralized Stablecoin of Solana

<Callout type="info">
  **Vision:** Stable money that no one can freeze, govern, or debase.
</Callout>

v1ta is a Solana-native, fully on-chain stablecoin built for people who believe money should be trustless, efficient, and unstoppable.

## The Problem

Stablecoins aren't actually stable in principle anymore:

- **USDC and USDT:** Centralized custodians, blacklist risk, traditional finance exposure
- **MakerDAO:** Governance committees, treasury bills, and permissioned collateral
- **Everything else:** Over-engineered or yield-farmed to death

DeFi has no pure, decentralized money left.

## The Solution

v1ta is base-layer money for Solana, backed only by crypto.

## Key Features

### 110% Collateralization Ratio

Borrow at just 110% collateral ratio. Lock $1000 in SOL, borrow $909 in VUSD. That's 11x better than competitors at 150 to 200%.

### Instant On-Chain Redemptions

VUSD stays at $1 because anyone can redeem it for $1 worth of collateral. No governance votes. No manual tweaks. Just math.

When VUSD trades below $1, arbitragers buy it cheap and redeem for $1. When it trades above $1, people mint new VUSD at $1 and sell it higher.

### Built for Solana Speed

Sub-second transactions at pennies. Dual oracles (Pyth and Switchboard) with 60-second staleness detection. Compare that to hours of lag on Ethereum.

### LST Protection

We calculate LST value using actual stake rates from staking contracts. Your position stays safe even when markets panic.

## Why v1ta?

> If USDC is Wall Street, v1ta is Bitcoin for stablecoins.

Pure collateral. Pure code. Pure Solana. Money without masters. The last pure stablecoin.

## Ecosystem Integration

v1ta is built on and integrated with Solana's leading DeFi protocols:

- **marginfi**: Flash liquidity and composable credit layer
- **Drift Protocol**: VUSD usable as collateral in perps and spot markets

## Launch Phases

1. **Devnet**: Core vault, Stability Pool, and marginfi keeper demo
2. **Testnet**: Add redemptions and Drift integration
3. **Mainnet**: Audited, immutable contracts with ecosystem adoption

  **Development Status:** v1ta is currently in devnet testing. Do not use with real funds.
