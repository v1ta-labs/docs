v1ta is a decentralized borrowing protocol that lets you mint VUSD stablecoin against SOL and LST collateral at just 110% collateralization ratio.

## Core Principles

### 1. Decentralized

- **No centralized control**: Immutable smart contracts
- **No governance**: Parameters are fixed at deployment
- **Crypto-only collateral**: SOL and liquid staking tokens only
- **No blacklists**: Truly permissionless

### 2. Capital Efficient

- **110% minimum collateral ratio**: Best-in-class capital efficiency
- **Maximum borrowing power**: Borrow up to about 90.9% of your collateral value
- **No interest rates**: Only pay a one-time 0.5% borrow fee

### 3. Stability Mechanisms

The protocol maintains VUSD at $1 USD through three mechanisms:

1. **Redemptions**: Burn VUSD for $1 worth of SOL
2. **Stability Pool**: Buffer against liquidations
3. **Arbitrage**: Market forces keep the peg

## Protocol Components

### CDP (Collateralized Debt Position)

A CDP is your position in the protocol. It consists of:

- **Collateral**: SOL (or LSTs) you've deposited
- **Debt**: VUSD you've borrowed
- **Collateral Ratio**: The health of your position

```
Collateral Ratio = (Collateral Value USD / Debt VUSD) Ã— 100%
```

<Callout type="info">
  One CDP per wallet address. Manage everything from a single position.
</Callout>

### VUSD Stablecoin

VUSD is the protocol's stablecoin:

- **Soft-pegged to $1 USD**
- **Backed by crypto collateral** (SOL and LSTs)
- **Redeemable**: Always exchange for $1 worth of collateral
- **Composable**: Usable across Solana DeFi

**Token Details:**
- Decimals: 6
- Mintable only by opening or adjusting positions
- Burnable through repayment or redemptions

### Stability Pool

The Stability Pool is the protocol's first line of defense against liquidations:

- **Deposits**: Users deposit VUSD
- **Purpose**: Repay liquidated debt
- **Rewards**: Earn SOL from liquidation penalties (4.5%)

When a position is liquidated:
1. Debt is paid by burning VUSD from the Stability Pool
2. Collateral is distributed pro-rata to depositors
3. 5% penalty: 0.5% to liquidator, 4.5% to pool

### Redemptions

Redemption is the mechanism that keeps VUSD at $1:

**How it works:**
1. Burn X VUSD
2. Receive $X worth of SOL (minus 0.5% fee)
3. Collateral comes from CDPs with lowest CR

**Why redemptions matter:**
- VUSD trades below $1? Arbitragers buy cheap VUSD and redeem for $1
- This buying pressure brings VUSD back to $1
- Purely algorithmic, no intervention needed

<Callout type="warning">
  **For CDP Owners:** Keeping your CR high reduces redemption risk.
</Callout>

### Liquidations

When a position's CR falls below 110%:

- **Anyone can liquidate** the position
- **Entire position is closed** at once
- **Liquidator reward**: 0.5% of collateral value
- **Stability Pool reward**: 4.5% of collateral value

**Liquidation Process:**
1. Liquidator calls `liquidate` instruction
2. Position debt is repaid from Stability Pool
3. Position collateral goes to Stability Pool depositors
4. Liquidator receives 0.5% reward
5. Position is marked as liquidated

## Oracle System

v1ta uses Pyth Network for real-time price feeds:

- **Feed**: SOL/USD
- **Update Frequency**: Sub-second
- **Max Staleness**: 60 seconds
- **Precision**: 8 decimals

<Callout type="info">
  **Future**: Dual oracle system with Switchboard for additional security.
</Callout>

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Min CR | 110% | Minimum collateralization ratio |
| Min Debt | 1 VUSD | Minimum borrowable amount |
| Borrow Fee | 0.5% | One-time fee when borrowing |
| Redemption Fee | 0.5% | Fee when redeeming VUSD for SOL |
| Liquidation Penalty | 5% | Penalty on liquidated collateral |
| Liquidator Reward | 0.5% | Reward for liquidators |
| SP Reward | 4.5% | Reward for Stability Pool |
| Max Price Age | 60s | Maximum oracle staleness |

## Protocol States

### Global State

The protocol maintains global state tracking:

- Total collateral locked
- Total VUSD debt outstanding
- Total positions opened
- Stability Pool status

### Position States

Each position can be in one of three states:

1. **Active**: Normal operating state
2. **Closed**: User has fully repaid and withdrawn
3. **Liquidated**: Position was liquidated due to low CR

## Protocol Flow

### Opening a Position

1. User deposits SOL collateral
2. Protocol calculates max borrowable amount
3. VUSD is minted (minus 0.5% fee)
4. Position is created and marked Active

### Liquidation Flow

1. Bot or user detects CR < 110%
2. Calls liquidate with position address
3. Stability Pool VUSD burns to cover debt
4. Collateral transfers to pool depositors
5. Liquidator receives 0.5% reward

### Redemption Flow

1. User burns X VUSD
2. Protocol finds CDPs with lowest CR
3. Extracts $X worth of SOL from those CDPs
4. Transfers SOL to user (minus 0.5% fee)
5. Reduces affected CDPs' debt proportionally

## Security Features

### No Governance Risk

- **Immutable contracts**: No upgrades or parameter changes
- **No admin keys**: No one can pause or modify the protocol
- **Deterministic**: Behavior is 100% predictable

### Oracle Security

- **Staleness checks**: Reject prices older than 60 seconds
- **Confidence intervals**: Validate oracle confidence
- **Fallback planned**: Dual oracle system coming

### Precision Handling

- **SOL**: 9 decimals (lamports)
- **VUSD**: 6 decimals
- **Prices**: 8 decimals (Pyth standard)
- **Calculations**: Proper scaling prevents overflow

### Economic Security

- **Liquidation incentives**: 0.5% reward ensures bot profitability
- **Stability Pool buffer**: Prevents bad debt accumulation
- **Redemption arbitrage**: Keeps VUSD pegged algorithmically

## Comparison with Other Protocols

| Feature | v1ta | MakerDAO | Liquity | Aave |
|---------|------|----------|---------|------|
| Min CR | 110% | 150% | 110% | 150%+ |
| Governance | None | DAO | None | DAO |
| Collateral | Crypto-only | RWAs + Crypto | ETH only | Multi-asset |
| Interest | 0% (flat fee) | Variable | 0% (flat fee) | Variable |
| Chain | Solana | Ethereum | Ethereum | Multi-chain |
| Speed | Sub-second | 15s+ | 15s+ | Varies |

## Why 110% Works

The 110% minimum collateral ratio is sustainable because:

1. **Fast liquidations**: Solana's speed enables sub-second liquidation bots
2. **Stability Pool buffer**: Absorbs bad debt before it affects the protocol
3. **Redemption mechanism**: Creates continuous price pressure toward $1
4. **Economic incentives**: Liquidators profit from maintaining protocol health

<Callout type="info">
  Liquity pioneered 110% CR on Ethereum. v1ta brings this efficiency to Solana with even faster liquidations.
