Welcome to v1ta! This guide walks you through everything you need to know to start using the protocol.

## What You Can Do

With v1ta, you can:

- **Open a CDP**: Deposit SOL and mint VUSD stablecoin
- **Manage Your Position**: Add or remove collateral, borrow more VUSD
- **Close Your Position**: Repay your debt and get your collateral back
- **Provide Liquidity**: Deposit VUSD in the Stability Pool to earn rewards

## What You'll Need

Before you start:

- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, or any compatible wallet)
- SOL tokens for collateral and transaction fees
- Basic understanding of collateralized lending

## Quick Start

<Steps>

<Step>
### Connect Your Wallet

Visit [v1ta.xyz](https://v1ta.xyz) and connect your Solana wallet.

Make sure you're on the correct network (Devnet for testing, Mainnet for production).
</Step>

<Step>
### Understand the Basics

Learn about:
- **Collateral Ratio**: The ratio of your collateral value to your debt (must be at least 110%)
- **Liquidation**: What happens when your collateral ratio falls below 110%
- **Fees**: 0.5% borrow fee, 5% liquidation penalty
</Step>

<Step>
### Open Your First Position

Deposit SOL collateral and mint VUSD. See the [Open a Position](/docs/getting-started/open-position) guide for detailed instructions.
</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor Your Position

Keep an eye on:
- Your collateral ratio (stay above 110%!)
- SOL price movements
- Your debt amount
</Step>

</Steps>

## Key Concepts

### Collateral Ratio

Your collateral ratio is calculated as:

```
Collateral Ratio = (Collateral Value in USD) / (Debt in VUSD) × 100
```

**Example:**
- You deposit 10 SOL (worth $1,000)
- You borrow 800 VUSD
- Your collateral ratio = ($1,000 / $800) × 100 = 125%

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Always maintain a collateral ratio above 110% to avoid liquidation.
</Callout>

### Minimum Collateral Ratio: 110%

v1ta's 110% minimum collateral ratio is the most capital-efficient in DeFi:

| Protocol | Min CR | Your $1000 Borrow |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| v1ta | 110% | $1,100 collateral |
| Competitor A | 150% | $1,500 collateral |
| Competitor B | 200% | $2,000 collateral |

### Liquidation

If your collateral ratio falls below 110%:

1. Anyone can liquidate your position
2. Your collateral is used to repay your debt
3. 5% liquidation penalty is applied:
   - 0.5% goes to the liquidator
   - 4.5% goes to the Stability Pool depositors

### Fees

- **Borrow Fee**: 0.5% on borrowed amount (one-time, added to debt)
- **Redemption Fee**: 0.5% when redeeming VUSD for SOL
- **Liquidation Penalty**: 5% of collateral value

## Safety Tips

<Callout type="warning">
  Follow these best practices to keep your position safe:
</Callout>

1. **Maintain a Healthy Buffer**: Keep your CR well above 110% (we recommend 130%+)
2. **Monitor SOL Price**: Watch for price drops that could reduce your CR
3. **Set Alerts**: Use tools to alert you when your CR is getting low
4. **Understand Liquidation**: Know the risks before opening a large position
5. **Start Small**: Test with a small position first
