# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

<Callout type="info">
  This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use the v1ta protocol and website.
</Callout>

## 1. Introduction

v1ta is a decentralized protocol built on the Solana blockchain. This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding data collection and use for:

- The v1ta website (docs.v1ta.xyz)
- The v1ta web application
- The v1ta smart contracts on Solana

**Important**: Blockchain transactions are public and permanent. Once data is recorded on-chain, it cannot be deleted or made private.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Blockchain Data (Public)

When you interact with the v1ta smart contracts, the following information is publicly recorded on the Solana blockchain:

- **Wallet Address**: Your public Solana wallet address
- **Transaction History**: All transactions you submit to the Protocol
- **Position Data**: Collateral amounts, debt amounts, and position status
- **Timestamps**: When transactions occurred
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: All function calls and parameters

This data is:
- **Public**: Anyone can view it using blockchain explorers
- **Permanent**: Cannot be deleted or modified
- **Pseudonymous**: Linked to your wallet address, not your real identity

### 2.2 Website Usage Data

Our website may collect:

- **IP Address**: For rate limiting and security

- Error tracking services

### 2.3 Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect or have access to:
